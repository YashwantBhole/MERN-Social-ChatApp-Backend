## 🖼 Image Upload Flow

1. Client uploads image
2. Backend uploads image to Cloudinary
3. Cloudinary URL is saved with the message

## ⚠ Authentication Note

This application **does not implement authentication**.

Reason:

- Focuses on messaging, sockets, media handling, and notifications
- Any user can join using a display name

> Authentication (JWT / OAuth) can be added easily in future iterations.
